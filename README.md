# Hotel-Manager

## Description

This program was a side project I set myself to really experiment with Tkinter UI and also to get a feel for classes and how to make use of them. The program allows you to start a hotel from scratch,  create the rooms that exists in the hotel and then track them as guests come and go.

The data latest state of your hotel can then be saved in a PICKLE file in the folder of the hotel.

In order to run the program, you simply need to have python installed on your pc.
